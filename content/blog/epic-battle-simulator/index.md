## About this game
{{<figure src = "photo4.jpeg" caption = "">}}
 
It's a strategic game with a large battle ground with limited space and lots of troops with different abilities. The main concept of the game is to form your strategies while choosing troops and placing them wisely on the battlefield. You need to defeat the opposite battlefield troops while choosing and placing troops correctly. The games provide limited money to buy troops and limited space to place the troops. When the battle starts, you can view the battle from a 3rd perspective in different angles and positions.
 
The game has three modes, such as levels, custom, and online. In the level mode, you can play numerous levels. Each with unique difficulties. Each level provides a limited amount of money to buy troops and limited space to place your troops. As each level you complete, you will earn diamonds, which can eventually be used to upgrade troops, or you can unloak new powerful troops.
 
In custom mode, you can play with troops as you want. This mode provides the maximum amount of money to buy troops and the maximum space to place troops. This is the only mode where you can control your battlefield and the opposite battlefield. This mode also provides daimonds, but they are significantly less than those in Level mode.
 
In online mode, you can play with a real player online. This is the only mode where you can get the maximum amount of daimonds. This mode may feel quite difficult compared to other modes at an initial stage. It's because in this mode, you'll get opponents at a random level that may be below or above your current level.
 
The main attraction of the game is the variety of troops with different abilities. Troops with similar abilities are placed in different sections. The ragdoll and physics effects make the game more intense.

The game's graphics are truly a sight to behold, with battlefields of a variety of environments and polygon-animated troops that create a sense of grandeur and chaos. The attention to detail in the visuals adds depth to the experience, making players feel like they're commanding a real army in the midst of an epic conflict.
 
## Cons
 
- The game may feel a thousand times better when it has a multiplayer mode to battle with friends.
 
- In online mode, the game does not provide opponent equivalence to players level.
 
 
## Overall
 
Epic Battle Simulator 2 for Android provides an engaging battle simulation experience with accurate troop movements and various customization options. The game could benefit from addressing user feedback to improve certain aspects, such as pricing and control over troops.
