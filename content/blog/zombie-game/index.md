## About this game

Zombie Catchers by Deca Games is a casual action-adventure game in a futuristic world riddled with a zombie invasion. It is a mid-violence game rated for 7+. The game has a download count of 1,000,000,000+.

According to this game, planet Earth is affected by the zombie virus, and most of the people have turned into zombies. At this time, there are two intergalactic businessmen, A.J. and Bud, who have decided to build a business empire. They hunt all the zombies and make Earth a safe place while also making a handsome profit by selling zombie juice.

A.J. and Bud walk through an undead wasteland where even plants can survive.

They make zombies who are hiding in a waste pond, hunt them down, and take them to an underground factory where all zombies are compressed and converted into zombie juice. You can earn coins by selling this zombie juice. The hidden zombies inside the waste pond were called out by putting a human brain near the pond. The zombies come out to eat the brain. At that time, A.J. and Bud try to catch each zombie. They hunt down zombies with a trusty harpoon gun and sneaky traps!

## GamePlay

The gameplay mechanisms are intuitive and enjoyable. The game provides comparatively fewer controls and smoother movement for characters. In this game, Bud and A.J. play different roles. While A.J. makes traps and hunts all the zombies down, Bud rides a flying ship that collects all the zombies A.J. has hunted and takes them all to the factory.

According to this game, A.J. is the main character in action. The player controls A.J. as he navigates through different environments, equipped with a harpoon gun and other gadgets to capture the zombies. The combination of exploration and strategic planning adds depth to the gameplay.

The controls are very simple and have very few of them. The smooth controls make the gamer no bore in the action. The game has many compressors that compress the zombies and convert them into zombie juice. Initially, there are two compressors, and each compressor gets unlocked as you reach various levels. Each compressor is upgradeable. The longer you upgrade, the more zombies the compressor can compress, and the compressing time also increases. Different compressors are used to compress different zombies to get different zombie juice. There are various environments available at various levels.

The weapon can be upgraded with your coins. The game provides different traps to trap the moving zombies, which unlock at different levels. Also, different outfits are available for A.J. as you reach higher levels. The variety of zombies, each with unique behaviors and different levels of juiciness, keeps the challenges fresh and ensures players need to adapt their approach.

## Design and graphics

One of the game's strengths is its design. The cartoonish art style creates a wonderful atmosphere, which makes the game different from the intense aesthetics of other zombie games. The character designs, especially those of A.J. and Bud, are charming and endearing. The insertion of humorous elements such as quick-witted zombie expressions adds an extra layer of enjoyment to the overall experience.

Moreover, the design extends to the game's interface, which is clean and user-friendly. Navigating through menus and upgrading equipment is straightforward, allowing players to focus on the core gameplay without unnecessary complications. The inclusion of in-game tutorials effectively guides new players, ensuring a smooth onboarding experience.

In terms of graphics, Zombie Catchers delivers a visually appealing presentation. The environments are well-crafted, ranging from urban settings to swamps, providing a diverse backdrop for zombie hunting. The attention to detail in character animations and the various tools used for zombie capture enhance the overall visual experience. The game also runs smoothly, even on devices with moderate hardware, ensuring accessibility for a wide audience.
